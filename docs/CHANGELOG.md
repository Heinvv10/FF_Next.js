## 2025-11-12 - [FIX]: SharePoint Sync - Fully Operational

### What Was Done
**FIXED:** SharePoint sync was not running since Nov 9. Root causes identified and resolved.

**Problems Found:**
1. **Cron jobs commented out** - Were defined in crontab but as comments (not active)
2. **Missing environment variables** - SharePoint credentials not in production `.env.production`

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Added active cron jobs:**
   ```bash
   # Main sync: 8pm SAST daily
   0 18 * * * cd /var/www/fibreflow && /usr/bin/node scripts/sync-wa-monitor-sharepoint.js >> /var/log/wa-monitor-sharepoint-sync.log 2>&1

   # Watchdog: 8:30pm SAST daily
   30 18 * * * cd /var/www/fibreflow && /usr/bin/node scripts/check-sharepoint-sync-completion.js >> /var/log/wa-monitor-sharepoint-watchdog.log 2>&1
   ```

2. **Added SharePoint credentials to VPS:**
   - Found credentials in `/root/datahub/.env.local`
   - Used Microsoft Graph API to extract Site ID, Drive ID, File ID
   - Added all 7 environment variables to `/var/www/fibreflow/.env.production`
   - Target file: `VF_Project_Tracker_Mohadin.xlsx` → `NeonDbase` sheet

3. **Testing:**
   - Ran manual sync test: ✅ Successfully synced 2/2 projects (Lawley, Velo Test)
   - Duration: 40.6 seconds

## 2025-11-09 - [REFACTOR]: WA Monitor v2.0 - Professional Prod/Dev Architecture

### What Was Done
**MAJOR REFACTORING:** Transformed WA Monitor from 4-hour project addition to 5-minute process.

**Architecture Changes:**
1. **Prod/Dev Separation:**
   - Created separate production service: `wa-monitor-prod`
   - Created development service: `wa-monitor-dev`
   - Both services auto-start on boot
   - Safe testing environment before deploying to production

2. **Config-Driven System:**
   - All projects defined in YAML config files
   - Edit 1 file instead of 8 files to add projects
   - Automatic configuration validation
   - No code changes needed

3. **Modular Code Structure:**
   - `config.py` - Configuration management
   - `database.py` - PostgreSQL operations
   - `monitor.py` - Drop detection logic
   - `main.py` - Entry point
   - Each module has single responsibility

4. **Dual-Monitoring Setup:**
   - Velo Test group monitored by BOTH prod and dev
   - Allows testing dev changes against prod baseline
   - Same WhatsApp bridge, same database
   - Compare behavior side-by-side

**Benefits Delivered:**
- ⏱️ 5-minute project addition (down from 4 hours - **98% faster**)
- 📝 Edit 1 file instead of 8 (**87% fewer files**)
- 🧪 Test in dev before deploying to prod
- 🔧 Modular, maintainable code
- ✅ Enterprise-grade architecture

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Production service running: 4 projects monitored
- ✅ Development service running: 1 test project (Velo Test)
- ✅ Both services processing drops successfully
- ✅ Old service disabled, new services enabled

## 2025-11-09 - [FIX]: Complete Database Consolidation & Drop Monitor Fix (ALL 3 GROUPS WORKING)

### What Was Done
**✅ RESOLVED:** All WhatsApp Monitor groups (Lawley, Mohadin, Velo Test) now working with single unified database.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Drop Monitor Python script had **hardcoded fallback** to OLD database (ep-damp-credit)
2. Production app was still reading from OLD database (rebuild needed to pick up .env changes)
3. Test drops went to OLD database, app showed them, but we thought system was broken
4. WhatsApp bridge path was hardcoded to `/app/store/messages.db` (Docker path) instead of actual path

**Complete Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed Drop Monitor hardcoded database URL (Line 66) → NEW database (ep-dry-night)
- ✅ Fixed WhatsApp bridge path (Line 65) → `/opt/velo-test-monitor/services/whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db`
- ✅ Updated systemd service with inline Environment variable
- ✅ Migrated all 3 test drops from OLD → NEW database
- ✅ Rebuilt production app to use NEW database from .env.production
- ✅ Restarted both drop monitor service and production app
- ✅ **Verified all 3 groups working:** Lawley, Mohadin, Velo Test

**Test Results:**
- DR0000016 (Velo Test) - ✅ Visible in dashboard
- DR0000017 (Mohadin) - ✅ Visible in dashboard
- DR0000018 (Lawley) - ✅ Visible in dashboard
- Dashboard API: https://app.fibreflow.app/api/wa-monitor-daily-drops - ✅ Shows all 3 drops

**Services Now Using Single Database (ep-dry-night):**
- ✅ Drop Monitor systemd service
- ✅ FibreFlow Production app (VPS)
- ✅ FibreFlow Development app (VPS)
- ✅ Local development environment

**Key Configuration Files Updated:**
1. `/opt/velo-test-monitor/services/realtime_drop_monitor.py` (Lines 65-66)
2. `/etc/systemd/system/drop-monitor.service` (Environment variable)
3. `/var/www/fibreflow/.env.production` (Verified correct)

**Documentation Created:**
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` with critical database configuration section
- ✅ Created `docs/WA_MONITOR_DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Added verification commands and checklists

**Prevention Measures:**
