# Contractors Module Documentation

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Vercel Routing Issue

**If you get 405 errors on contractor endpoints, read this first:**

👉 **[VERCEL_ROUTING_FIX.md](./VERCEL_ROUTING_FIX.md)** - Complete documentation of the Vercel dynamic route bug and solution

**TL;DR:** Dynamic routes like `/api/contractors/[id]` return 405 on Vercel. Use flat endpoints instead:
- ✅ `/api/contractors-update` (PUT with id in body)
- ✅ `/api/contractors-delete` (POST with id in body)
- ❌ `/api/contractors/[id]` (broken on Vercel)

**Last Verified:** October 30, 2025 - Working in production

## 🎯 Module Overview

The Contractors module manages fiber network contractor relationships, including:

- **Contractor CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete contractor records
- **Team Management**: Organize contractors into specialized teams
- **Document Management**: Upload, verify, and track contractor documents
- **Onboarding**: Guide contractors through registration and approval
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor certifications, safety, and regulatory compliance
- **Performance Metrics**: RAG scoring across 5 dimensions
- **Applications**: Approve/reject contractor applications

## 📊 Current Status (Oct 24, 2025)

### Foundation Assessment Results

| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Database Schema | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Excellent - 5 normalized tables, proper indexes |
| API Routes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Good - Some CRUD endpoints missing |
| Frontend Components | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.5/5) | Very Good - Well organized, needs refactoring |
| Services Layer | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Good - Some consolidation needed |
| Documentation | ⭐⭐⭐ (3.5/5) | Needs Work - Missing architecture docs |
| Test Coverage | ⭐⭐ (2/5) | Poor - Only ~20% coverage |

## 📚 Using BMad Methodology

This module follows the **BMad (Agile AI-Driven)** development methodology.

### BMad Workflow for Contractors Module

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Story Selected] --> B[SM: Draft Story]
    B --> C[Dev: Implement + Tests]
    C --> D[QA: Review + Gate]
    D --> E{Pass?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Commit & Deploy]
    E -->|No| C
    F --> A
```

### Story Development Cycle

1. **Scrum Master (SM)**: Drafts story from backlog with acceptance criteria
2. **Developer (Dev)**: Implements story with tests
3. **QA (Test Architect)**: Reviews code and creates quality gate
4. **Commit**: Merge and deploy when gate passes
5. **Repeat**: Move to next story

### BMad Commands (if using IDE integration)

```bash
# Scrum Master
@sm Draft next story from Epic 1

# Developer
@dev Implement Story 1.1 team CRUD endpoints

# QA (Test Architect)
@qa *review Story 1.1
@qa *trace Story 1.1
@qa *nfr Story 1.1
```
