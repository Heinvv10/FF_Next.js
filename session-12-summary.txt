CONCLUSION
============================================================

Session 12 successfully integrated FibreFlow's premium component system
into the foto-review module. The visual quality and consistency have been
significantly improved with glassmorphism effects, neon glows, and premium
animations.

All custom styled elements have been replaced with standardized components
(VelocityButton, GlassCard), making the module consistent with the rest of
the FibreFlow application.

The project is now at 32.9% completion with a polished, premium UI that
matches the FibreFlow brand and design system.

STATUS: ✅ SESSION 12 COMPLETE
Next agent should focus on dark mode support and photo gallery styling.
