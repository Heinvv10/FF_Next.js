/**
 * Lodash Replacement Utilities
 *
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This file has been refactored into modular utilities
 *
 * New structure: src/utils/lodash-replacement/
 * - timing.ts: debounce, throttle
 * - objects.ts: cloneDeep, isEqual, pick, omit, merge
 * - arrays.ts: flatten, flattenDeep, uniq, uniqBy, chunk, groupBy, keyBy
 * - metrics.ts: LodashReplacementMetrics
 * - index.ts: Central exports
 *
 * This file re-exports everything for backward compatibility.
 * Please update imports to use: import { debounce } from '@/utils/lodash-replacement'
