# WA Monitor Auto-Responder Skill

Automatically detect WhatsApp Monitor issues and proactively invoke the WA agent for investigation.

## Purpose

This skill makes Claude Code proactive about WA Monitor issues by:
1. Detecting drop numbers, service issues, and validation problems
2. Automatically invoking the WA agent (without user having to ask)
3. Running diagnostics and reporting findings
4. Providing actionable next steps

## When to Activate

### Trigger 1: Drop Number Mentioned

**Pattern**: `DR[0-9]{6,7}` (e.g., DR1734306, DR470165)

**User says**:
- "Check DR1734306"
- "Why isn't DR470165 showing?"
- "DR1857337 is missing"

**Automatic Actions**:
1. Extract drop number from user message
2. Silently invoke WA agent
3. Check if drop exists in database
4. Check if drop was rejected (validation)
5. Check monitor logs for processing
6. Report findings with context

**Response Template**:
```
🔍 Investigating DR[NUMBER]...

Database Check: ✅ Found / ❌ Not found
Validation: ✅ Valid / ❌ Rejected / ⏭️ No validation
Last Processed: [timestamp]
Submitted By: [phone/name]
Project: [project name]

[Additional context if issues found]
```

3. Look up LIDs in WhatsApp database
4. Provide fix commands
5. Explain how to prevent

**Response Template**:
```
🔗 LID Issue Detected:

Drops with LIDs: [count] found

[List drops with LIDs]

Resolution Steps:
1. Look up LID → phone number
2. Update database
3. Restart monitor (clear cache)

[Provide exact commands]

**Response Template**:
```
➕ Adding New WhatsApp Group (5 minutes):

Prerequisites:
- WhatsApp bridge in group (064 041 2391)
- Group JID: [check if provided]

Steps:
1. Find Group JID (if not provided)
2. Test in DEV first
3. Deploy to PROD
4. Verify monitoring

[Provide exact commands for each step]
```

## Auto-Activation Rules

### DO Automatically (No User Confirmation Needed):
- ✅ Investigate drop numbers mentioned
- ✅ Check service status when issues reported
- ✅ Query daily stats when requested
- ✅ Diagnose validation problems

### ASK First:
- ❓ Restarting services
- ❓ Modifying configuration files
- ❓ Updating database records
- ❓ Adding new projects

### DON'T (Never Do Without Explicit Request):
- ❌ Restart production services
- ❌ Modify Python code
- ❌ Change database data
- ❌ Edit config files

## Session Start Health Check

**Automatically run at session start**:
1. Silent health check of WA Monitor
2. Only alert if issues detected
3. Keep quiet if all healthy

**Implementation**:
```
[Session starts]
  ↓
WA Skill: *Silently checks services*
  ↓
IF issues detected:
  "⚠️ WA Monitor Health Alert: [issue]. Investigate?"
ELSE:
  [Stay quiet, all good]
```

## Integration with WA Agent

This skill acts as a **dispatcher** for the WA agent:

```
User mentions WA Monitor issue
  ↓
WA Monitor Skill (this file) detects trigger
  ↓
Skill automatically invokes WA Agent
  ↓
WA Agent runs diagnostics (uses .claude/agents/wa-agent.md)
  ↓
WA Agent reports findings
  ↓
Skill formats response for user
  ↓
Claude presents results
```

## Response Tone

- 🎯 **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- 📊 **Data-first**: Show the numbers/status
- 🔧 **Actionable**: Provide next steps
- ⚡ **Fast**: Don't make user wait
- 🤐 **Quiet when healthy**: Only speak up if there's an issue

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Drop Investigation
```
User: "Check DR1734306"
  ↓
Skill: [Detects DR pattern, invokes WA agent]
  ↓
Claude: "🔍 Investigating DR1734306...

Database: ✅ Found
Project: Lawley
Submitted: 13:26 by 27711558396
Status: Resubmission (original: 2025-11-15)
All QA steps: Complete

✅ Drop is in system and processed correctly."
```

### Example 2: Service Down
```
User: "Why aren't drops showing?"
  ↓
Skill: [Detects service issue keywords, invokes WA agent]
  ↓
Claude: "🏥 Running health check...

⚠️ Issue Found:
  wa-monitor-dev: ❌ inactive (exit code 1)
  wa-monitor-prod: ✅ active
  whatsapp-bridge: ✅ active

Last error (dev): [error message]

Fix: systemctl restart wa-monitor-dev

Would you like me to investigate the dev service error?"
```

### Example 3: Daily Stats
```
User: "How many drops today?"
  ↓
Skill: [Detects stats request, invokes WA agent]
  ↓
Claude: "📊 Today's Drops (2025-11-17):

Lawley:    3 drops
Mamelodi:  1 drop
Velo Test: 1 drop

Total: 5 drops"
```

## Configuration

**Enable by default**: Yes (always active)

**Disable** with:
- "Disable WA auto-respond"
- "Stop auto WA checks"

**Re-enable** with:
- "Enable WA auto-respond"
- "Resume WA auto-checks"

## Status Indicators

Use emoji indicators for quick scanning:

- 🔍 Investigating
- ✅ Healthy/Found/Success
- ❌ Error/Not found/Failed
- ⚠️ Warning/Issue detected
- 📊 Statistics
- 🔗 LID resolution
- 🚫 Validation rejection
- ➕ Adding new item
- 🏥 Health check
- 🔧 Fix available
- ⏭️ Skipped/Disabled

## Success Criteria

Skill is successful when:
- ✅ User doesn't need to say "use WA agent"
- ✅ Issues are diagnosed within 5 seconds
- ✅ Response is clear and actionable
- ✅ Next steps are obvious
- ✅ No false positives (triggering when shouldn't)
- ✅ Quiet when everything is healthy

## Monitoring Own Performance

Track these metrics mentally:
1. How often triggered correctly vs incorrectly
2. User satisfaction with auto-responses
3. Time saved (user didn't have to ask explicitly)
4. False positive rate

Adjust sensitivity if:
- Too many false triggers → Tighten keyword matching
- Missing obvious issues → Expand trigger phrases
- User frequently overrides → Make less aggressive
