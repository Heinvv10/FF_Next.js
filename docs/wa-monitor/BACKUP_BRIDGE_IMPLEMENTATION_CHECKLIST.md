curl http://localhost:8082/health
```

**Expected:** Both return `{"status":"ok","connected":true}`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Primary health OK
- [ ] Backup health OK

---

#### Test 3: Parallel Message Capture

**Post test drop to Velo Test:** `DR9999901`

```bash
# Check primary log
tail -20 /opt/velo-test-monitor/logs/whatsapp-bridge.log | grep "DR9999901"

**Restart primary:**

```bash
systemctl start whatsapp-bridge-prod
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Backup captured message during primary outage
- [ ] Database shows correct bridge_source
- [ ] Primary restarted successfully
- [ ] Both bridges now active

## Post-Implementation Monitoring (24 Hours)

### Hour 1: Immediate Monitoring

```bash
# Watch both logs
tmux new-session \; \
  split-window -h \; \
  send-keys "tail -f /opt/velo-test-monitor/logs/whatsapp-bridge.log" C-m \; \
  select-pane -t 0 \; \
  send-keys "tail -f /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup/logs/whatsapp-bridge-backup.log" C-m
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors in either log
- [ ] Both bridges capturing messages
- [ ] No duplicate database entries

---

### Hour 6: Performance Check

```bash
# Compare message counts
psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aRNLhZc1G2CD@ep-dry-night-a9qyh4sj-pooler.gwc.azure.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" -c "
  SELECT bridge_source, COUNT(*) as message_count
  FROM qa_photo_reviews
  WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
  GROUP BY bridge_source;
"
```

**Expected:** Roughly 50/50 split (depends on timing)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Both bridges capturing messages
- [ ] No significant performance issues
- [ ] CPU/memory usage normal

---

### Hour 24: Full Evaluation

```bash
# Health check
/opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup/health-check.sh

# Daily statistics
psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aRNLhZc1G2CD@ep-dry-night-a9qyh4sj-pooler.gwc.azure.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" -c "
  SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    bridge_source,
    COUNT(*) as drops
  FROM qa_photo_reviews
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  GROUP BY DATE(created_at), bridge_source
  ORDER BY date DESC, bridge_source;
"
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Both bridges operational for 24 hours
- [ ] No unexpected restarts
- [ ] Message capture rate acceptable
- [ ] No database issues

---

## Success Criteria

**All must be checked:**

- [ ] Both bridges show "active (running)"
- [ ] Both health endpoints return OK
- [ ] Same messages appear in both logs
- [ ] Only one database entry per drop (deduplication works)
- [ ] Failover test passed (backup took over when primary stopped)
- [ ] Dashboard shows drops correctly
- [ ] No errors in monitor logs
- [ ] Health check shows "REDUNDANT (Both bridges operational)"
- [ ] 24-hour monitoring completed without issues

---

## Rollback Procedure

**If something goes wrong:**

```bash
# 1. Stop backup bridge
systemctl stop whatsapp-bridge-backup
systemctl disable whatsapp-bridge-backup

# 2. Stop failover monitor
systemctl stop bridge-failover-monitor
systemctl disable bridge-failover-monitor

# 3. Verify primary is working
systemctl status whatsapp-bridge-prod
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 4. Check monitors using primary
tail -f /opt/wa-monitor/prod/logs/wa-monitor-prod.log

# 5. Archive backup setup
mv /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup.disabled

# 6. Document what went wrong
nano /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup.disabled/ROLLBACK_REASON.txt
```

## Contact & Support

**Issues During Implementation?**

1. Check logs: `tail -100 /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup/logs/whatsapp-bridge-backup.log`
2. Check systemd: `journalctl -u whatsapp-bridge-backup -n 50`
3. Verify compilation: `file /opt/whatsapp-bridge-backup/whatsapp-bridge`
4. Test health: `curl http://localhost:8082/health`

**Common Issues:**
- **Pairing code not appearing:** Clear old session and restart service
- **Port conflict:** Check if 8082 in use: `netstat -tuln | grep 8082`
- **Database errors:** Verify Neon connection string and credentials
- **Messages not captured:** Verify number added to all groups
